## Typing stubs for SQLAlchemy

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `SQLAlchemy` package. It
can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`SQLAlchemy`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/SQLAlchemy. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

The `sqlalchemy-stubs` package is an alternative to this package and also includes a mypy plugin for more precise types.

*Note:* The `SQLAlchemy` package includes type annotations or type stubs
since version 2.0.0. Please uninstall the `types-SQLAlchemy`
package if you use this or a newer version.


See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `e816acffddf9d984bac131224b0eb0f6a3e1c9fc`.
