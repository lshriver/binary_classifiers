## Typing stubs for invoke

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`invoke`](https://github.com/pyinvoke/invoke) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`invoke`.

This version of `types-invoke` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `invoke==2.0.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/invoke. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

*Note:* The `invoke` package includes type annotations or type stubs
since version 2.1.2. Please uninstall the `types-invoke`
package if you use this or a newer version.


This stub package is marked as [partial](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/#partial-stub-packages).
If you find that annotations are missing, feel free to contribute and help complete them.


See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `35873ec3d874d3974edad0cc398b748d6dcef711` and was tested
with mypy 1.6.1, pyright 1.1.332, and
pytype 2023.10.17.
