## Typing stubs for pytest-lazy-fixture

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`pytest-lazy-fixture`](https://github.com/tvorog/pytest-lazy-fixture) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`pytest-lazy-fixture`.

This version of `types-pytest-lazy-fixture` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `pytest-lazy-fixture==0.6.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/pytest-lazy-fixture. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `7c26da22bda786dce26d3a70fc18c14a7f4bd378` and was tested
with mypy 1.10.1, pyright 1.1.370, and
pytype 2024.4.11.
