## Typing stubs for PyScreeze

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`PyScreeze`](https://github.com/asweigart/pyscreeze) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`PyScreeze`.

This version of `types-PyScreeze` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `PyScreeze==1.0.1`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/PyScreeze. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.

with mypy 1.11.1, pyright 1.1.377, and
