## Typing stubs for paho-mqtt

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`paho-mqtt`](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.python) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`paho-mqtt`.

This version of `types-paho-mqtt` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `paho-mqtt==1.6.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/paho-mqtt. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

*Note:* The `paho-mqtt` package includes type annotations or type stubs
since version 2.0.0. Please uninstall the `types-paho-mqtt`
package if you use this or a newer version.


See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `5c75292f26aec8e6348a17d32077f408a1337988` and was tested
with mypy 1.9.0, pyright 1.1.354, and
pytype 2024.3.19.
