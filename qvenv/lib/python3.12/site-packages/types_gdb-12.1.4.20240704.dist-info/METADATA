## Typing stubs for gdb

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`gdb`](https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=binutils-gdb.git;a=tree) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`gdb`.

This version of `types-gdb` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `gdb==12.1.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/gdb. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

Type hints for GDB's [Python API](https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Python-API.html). Note that this API is available only when running Python scripts under GDB: it is not possible to install the `gdb` package separately, for instance using `pip`.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `aa44da652e7a8bc0171c882469a95214640515a7` and was tested
with mypy 1.10.1, pyright 1.1.370, and
pytype 2024.4.11.
