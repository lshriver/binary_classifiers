## Typing stubs for braintree

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`braintree`](https://github.com/braintree/braintree_python) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`braintree`.

This version of `types-braintree` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `braintree==4.30.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/braintree. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit
[`a94c927642eda093db226eb3e21c3a4681577f85`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/commit/a94c927642eda093db226eb3e21c3a4681577f85) and was tested
with mypy 1.11.1, pyright 1.1.381, and
pytype 2024.9.13.
