## Typing stubs for psycopg2

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`psycopg2`](https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`psycopg2`.

This version of `types-psycopg2` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `psycopg2==2.9.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/psycopg2. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit
[`937270df0c25dc56a02f7199f1943fdb7d47aa9d`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/commit/937270df0c25dc56a02f7199f1943fdb7d47aa9d) and was tested
with mypy 1.11.1, pyright 1.1.376, and
pytype 2024.4.11.
