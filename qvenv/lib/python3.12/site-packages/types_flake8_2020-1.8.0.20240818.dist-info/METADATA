## Typing stubs for flake8-2020

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`flake8-2020`](https://github.com/asottile/flake8-2020) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`flake8-2020`.

This version of `types-flake8-2020` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `flake8-2020==1.8.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/flake8-2020. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

*Note:* `types-flake8-2020` is unmaintained and won't be updated.


See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
