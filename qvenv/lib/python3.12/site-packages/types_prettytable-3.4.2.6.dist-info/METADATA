## Typing stubs for prettytable

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `prettytable` package. It
can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`prettytable`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/prettytable. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

*Note:* The `prettytable` package includes type annotations or type stubs
since version 3.5.0. Please uninstall the `types-prettytable`
package if you use this or a newer version.


See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `6fd7e36e80e0448d9199d62d582c659c147be149`.
