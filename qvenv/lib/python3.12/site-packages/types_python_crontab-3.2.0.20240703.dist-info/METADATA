## Typing stubs for python-crontab

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`python-crontab`](https://gitlab.com/doctormo/python-crontab) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`python-crontab`.

This version of `types-python-crontab` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `python-crontab==3.2.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/python-crontab. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `989e25043cdf1a09bada0ccfd68c9d0e4799abfb` and was tested
with mypy 1.10.1, pyright 1.1.369, and
pytype 2024.4.11.
