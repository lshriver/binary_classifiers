## Typing stubs for humanfriendly

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`humanfriendly`](https://github.com/xolox/python-humanfriendly) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`humanfriendly`.

This version of `types-humanfriendly` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `humanfriendly==10.0.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/humanfriendly. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `1c184fea33d50ba430410cf1b25d4aea2df2981e` and was tested
with mypy 1.6.1, pyright 1.1.332, and
pytype 2023.10.17.
