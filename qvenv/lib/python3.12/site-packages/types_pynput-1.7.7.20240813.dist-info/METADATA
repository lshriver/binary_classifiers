## Typing stubs for pynput

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`pynput`](https://github.com/moses-palmer/pynput) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`pynput`.

This version of `types-pynput` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `pynput==1.7.7`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/pynput. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit
[`37807d753a0e56a178b4c38f80879a4c90592ef3`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/commit/37807d753a0e56a178b4c38f80879a4c90592ef3) and was tested
with mypy 1.11.1, pyright 1.1.375, and
pytype 2024.4.11.
