## Typing stubs for D3DShot

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `D3DShot` package. It
can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`D3DShot`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/D3DShot. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

*Note:* `types-D3DShot` is unmaintained and won't be updated.


See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `6a37fb050a5e785482016bbd914901dde3bed553`.
