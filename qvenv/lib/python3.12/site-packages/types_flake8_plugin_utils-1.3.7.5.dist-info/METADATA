## Typing stubs for flake8-plugin-utils

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `flake8-plugin-utils` package. It
can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`flake8-plugin-utils`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/flake8-plugin-utils. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

*Note:* The `flake8-plugin-utils` package includes type annotations or type stubs
since version 1.3.3. Please uninstall the `types-flake8-plugin-utils`
package if you use this or a newer version.


This stub package is marked as [partial](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/#partial-stub-packages).
If you find that annotations are missing, feel free to contribute and help complete them.


See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `afe18e95a9592434e93b648de5194cfe54443f84` and was tested
with mypy 1.4.1, pyright 1.1.318, and
pytype 2023.6.16.
