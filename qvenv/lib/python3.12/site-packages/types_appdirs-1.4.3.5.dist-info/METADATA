## Typing stubs for appdirs

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `appdirs` package. It
can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`appdirs`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/appdirs. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

The `appdirs` package has been deprecated in favour of the `platformdirs` package, which ships with a `py.typed` file. Users should migrate their `appdirs` code to use `platformdirs` instead, which will remove the need for the `types-appdirs` package.

*Note:* `types-appdirs` is unmaintained and won't be updated.


See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `7e0b9b44dea0b170081cafd596c2804089dc2125`.
